# table_scraper.py
Working on a python script which extracts table elements from html files -- currently working with a specific case -> goal is to eventually have the code able to extract any and all tables from a webpage for data processing/manipulations.

While there are many python libraries for working with html files (Beautiful Soup, Selenium, etc.) I want to be able to be able to write a script which will be able to perform some of those functionalities without the external library dependencies.
